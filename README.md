# Emacs Introduction

To try out the configuration shipped with this repository

- open `conf.org` with Emacs >= 24 (`Emacs -Q` if you want to discard existing configurations)
- `M-x org-babel-tangle`

This will generate a `conf.el` file that contains the full configuration used.
Simply open that file and `M-x load-file RET conf.el`
